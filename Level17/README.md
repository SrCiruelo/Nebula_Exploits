# LEVEL17 Walkthrough 


LEVEL17 given code:

```py

#!/usr/bin/python

import os
import pickle
import time
import socket
import signal

signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, signal.SIG_IGN)

def server(skt):
  line = skt.recv(1024)

  obj = pickle.loads(line)

  for i in obj:
      clnt.send("why did you send me " + i + "?\n")

skt = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
skt.bind(('0.0.0.0', 10007))
skt.listen(10)

while True:
  clnt, addr = skt.accept()

  if(os.fork() == 0):
      clnt.send("Accepted connection from %s:%d" % (addr[0], addr[1]))
      server(clnt)
      exit(1)

```
The program seems like a server that opens sockets connection with anyone who request it.
When a connection is requested the server sends an Accepted message connection and waits for a response,
the response is then interpreted with the pickle package.

Let's check what is a pickle:

#### [From the python documentation: ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

*The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure*

If there is function from loading package there needs to be a function for creating that function is called dump:
```py
 pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)
```

Now we should be able to interact with the program with NetCat and python.

```py
import pickle 

sample = {"k0":"v0","k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}

pickle.dump(sample,open("sample.p","wb")) #Create pickle file named sample.p

output_sample = pickle.load(open("sample.p","rb"))

print(output_sample)

```

As we can see pickle is doing something completly different from Nebula


Now we can use NetCat to communicate with the server

```sh
 C:\Users\migue\Documents\Nebula_Exploits\Level17>nc 192.168.56.101 10007 < sample.p
 Accepted connection from 192.168.56.1:64993    
```

Even though we sent the file through a pickle server we are not getting 
the expected response, seems like pickle is not loading well the file.
The problem might be because of Nebula older version of pickle.

Let's check it from my Nebula
```sh
///////////////MY PC

C:\Users\migue\Documents\Nebula_Exploits\Level17>cat sample.p
□□# □(□k0□□v0□□k1□□v1□□k2□□v2□u.

///////////////NEBULA

p1
S 'v2'
p2
sS 'k1'
p3

p4

p6
```

Now that we got the code working let's get back to pickle documentation:

```

Warning

The pickle module is not secure. Only unpickle data you trust.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never unpickle data that could have come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.

Consider signing data with hmac if you need to ensure that it has not been tampered with.

Safer serialization formats such as json may be more appropriate if you are processing untrusted data. See Comparison with json.
