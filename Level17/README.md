# LEVEL17 Walkthrough 


LEVEL17 given code:

```py

#!/usr/bin/python

import os
import pickle
import time
import socket
import signal

signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, signal.SIG_IGN)

def server(skt):
  line = skt.recv(1024)

  obj = pickle.loads(line)

  for i in obj:
      clnt.send("why did you send me " + i + "?\n")

skt = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
skt.bind(('0.0.0.0', 10007))
skt.listen(10)

while True:
  clnt, addr = skt.accept()

  if(os.fork() == 0):
      clnt.send("Accepted connection from %s:%d" % (addr[0], addr[1]))
      server(clnt)
      exit(1)

```
The program seems like a server that opens sockets connection with anyone who request it.
When a connection is requested the server sends an Accepted message connection and waits for a response,
the response is then interpreted with the pickle package.

Let's check what is a pickle:

#### [From the python documentation: ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

*The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure*

If there is function from loading package there needs to be a function for creating that function is called dump:
```py
 pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)
```
